Recently, I've been discussing with some friends around why I like to
use Emacs as my primary text editor, and it's got me thinking about
what the Emacs platform offers over other, more traditional, text
editors &amp; IDEs. When you hear Emacs advocates talk about Emacs, you
often hear them extolling its extensibility, its adaptability, and its
capacity to be self-documenting. But, as an outsider, it's difficult
to understand what these things really mean, and even harder to
understand why Emacs is so powerful and dynamic. I'm not here to try
and convert you to being an Emacs user, but I want to make a case for
why its design and philosophy is compelling, and worth iterating on.

<h2 id="orgc13d5d2">Preface</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc13d5d2">
<p>
Emacs, at its core, is a Lisp interpreter. The Emacs codebase has two
major sections, its <code>src</code> folder, which contains the core of the
application in C, and the <code>lisp</code> folder, which contains most of the
application's features written in Elisp (Emacs' custom flavor of
Lisp). Looking into the <code>src</code> folder, we find that most of the C code
is either dedicated towards interpreting and executing Elisp code, or
working with the underlying operating system to display windows, do
I/O, and receive user input.
</p>

<p>
The C core of Emacs serves to provide an Elisp interpreter, as well as
a graphical interface to do that interpretation. Almost all the
interesting things that Emacs does are built entirely in Elisp. Emacs
provides a complete interface for interacting with your computer,
allowing you to, if you wanted, do all of your computing tasks
entirely through Lisp.
</p>

<p>
Making Lisp interpretation a primitive in how you do your computing is
powerful, and is key to enabling the extensible, adaptable, and
self-documenting nature of Emacs.

<h2 id="org4efcb5c">Why Lisp is Unique</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4efcb5c">
<p>
If you're already familiar with Lisp, feel free to skip this section
without missing key content, but for those of you who are new to, or
uncertain about Lisp, you are invited you to read on.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to borrow an example from the classic <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> (henceforth referred to as
<i>sicp</i>) that directly shows the power, and uniqueness, of Lisp.

<h3 id="orgeae4e38">Symbolic Differentiation in Lisp</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeae4e38">
<p>
I want to write a program that can transform simple mathematical
expressions into their derivates.
</p>

<p>
Generally, I want some function \(d\) that mimics the behavior below
(written in psuedo-code):
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">d(x^2 + 2x + 1)
&gt; 2x + 2
</code></pre>

<p>
Where \(d\) can accept any mathematical expression on x as an argument
(in whatever mathematical syntax you like), and produce the expression
representing the derivative of the input (in that same syntax). I also
want an easy way to evaluate that resulting expression.
</p>

<p>
Most coders will jump to representing the input and output of \(d\) as
a string, opting for some ASCII friendly mathematical syntax. The
traditional, C-like, approach would be to provide a function like this
(the below is a theoretical API in Python):
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">d("x**2 + 2*x + 1")
&gt; "2*x + 2"
</code></pre>

<p>
However, taking that <code>2*x + 2</code> string output, and then using it to do
real calculations, is a little tricky. If you're using Python you
would need to invoke the Python interpreter, or some other
interpreter, to parse and process that <code>2*x + 2</code> string for a given
value of \(x\). Actually implementing \(d\) would also be very tricky,
since you would need a way to parse that input expression into a data
structure, do something to that data structure, and then convert that
data structure back into an expression.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example API for the \(d\) function in Lisp.
</p>

<p>
<i>if you want details on how to actually implement this function, refer
to the chapter of sicp linked <a href="https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/chapters/2.3.2.html">here</a>, it's well worth the read</i>
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">(d '(+ (+ (* x x)
          (* 2 x))
       1))
&gt; (+ (* 2 x) 2)
</code></pre>

<p>
Every lisp expression (<i>what you see in each pair of ( )</i>) starts with
a function call. Everything else in the expression is an argument to
that function. So <code>(+ 2 3)</code> is equivalent to <code>2 + 3</code> in regular math
notation. This might seem weird at first, but turns out to be a very
powerful way of expressing operations, not much different than
traditional function notation, e.g. <code>add(2, 3)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Above, we call the function \(d\) on the list, <code>'(+ (+ (* x x) (* 2
x)) 1)</code>. In Lisp, a pair of <code>'( )</code> preceded by a <code>'</code> is a list. It
looks like Lisp syntax doesn't it? But for now that syntax is being
treated as a list. And that really is a list, just like in normal
programming. It's just using <code>( )</code> instead of <code>[ ]</code>. If you're still
confused, replace every <code>( )</code> with <code>[ ]</code> and see if it starts to look
familiar. Here's the same data structure in Python:
</p>

<p>
<code>["+", ["+", ["*", "x", "x"], ["*", "2", "x"]], "1"]</code>
</p>

<p>
Since it's a list, you can index into it like a normal list. Here we
index the first element of the list.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">(nth 0 '(+ (+ (* x x) (* 2 x)) 1))
&gt; +
</code></pre>

<p>
And the second.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">(nth 1 '(+ (+ (* x x) (* 2 x)) 1))
&gt; (+ (* x x) (* 2 x))
</code></pre>

<p>
But importantly, as you've already seen, that list is also valid Lisp
code! Which we can evaluate!
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">(defun evaluate_second_element (x)
  (eval (nth 1 '(+ (+ (* x x) (* 2 x)) 1))))
(evaluate_second_element 2)

&gt; 8
</code></pre>

<p>
Take a moment to absorb and piece together what is happening in that
code above. This is the one of the superpowers of Lisp. We are
defining a function called <code>evaluate_second_element</code>, which
finds the second expression in our list using the <code>nth</code> function, and
then evaluates the output of <code>nth</code> using the input of <code>x</code> passed into
<code>evaluate_second_element</code>.
</p>

<p>
Let me walk through how to conceptualize what the lisp interpreter is doing.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">;; We define our function here
(defun evaluate_second_expression (x)
  (eval (nth 1 '(+ (+ (* x x) (* 2 x)) 1))))

;; When we call the function: 
(evaluate_second_expression 2)

;; Lisp evaluates
(nth 1 '(+ (+ (* x x) (* 2 x)) 1)))

;; to
'(+ (* x x) (* 2 x))

;; And passes that to the 'eval' function,
(eval '(+ (* x x) (* 2 x)))

;; Eval takes that list, and evaluates it as a lisp expression
;; replacing any variables with ones it can find in its local
;; scope. Since we defined x when we called evaluate_second_expression
;; the above evaluates to:
(+ (* 2 2) (* 2 2))

;; Which of course evaluates to
8
</code></pre>

<p>
How you would implement the same thing above in Python, or another
C-like, procedural, language? It's hard to think of a program in an
other language that can do what Lisp is doing here as elegantly or
succinctly.
</p>

<p>
Key to what's happening here is that Lisp code can both be evaluated
as normal code and treated as a <i>data structure</i>. Which allows us to
manipulate Lisp code <i>as data</i>, and then <i>execute</i> that data after we've
transformed it. You'll hear Lisp enthusiasts saying "data is code,
code is data", which is an oversimplification, but is driving home the
point above.
</p>

<p>
If we were to do something similar in Python, we could use the Python
interpreter to evaluate strings of Python code at runtime, but we'd
run into a headache when we want to do some interesting
manipulation of the strings of Python code.
</p>

<p>
Coming back to our \(d\) function, once we've created an expression
representing the derivative of our input, we can easily evaluate that
expression.
</p>

<p>
Recall that our \(d\) function works like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">(d '(+ (+ (* x x) (* 2 x)) 1))
&gt; (+ (* 2 x) 2)
</code></pre>

<p>
Let's write another function, that allows us to pass in a Lisp math
expression on <code>x</code> as the first argument, and a value for <code>x</code> as the
second argument that the function will use to evaluate the derivative.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">(defun derivative_at (expression x)
  (eval (d expression)))

(derivative_at '((+ (+ (* x x) (* 2 x)) 1)) 2)

&gt; 6
</code></pre>

<p>
That's it!
</p>

<h3 id="orga4a9f03">Lisp is Functional</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga4a9f03">
<p>
For most functions you write in Lisp, you cannot change the data in
your inputs. A key part of Lisp being <i>functional</i> is that its
functions have no <i>side effects</i>. When you pass an input into your
functions, you have a guarantee that your inputs are going to be the
same after you call that function.
</p>

<p>
In general, this also means that Lisp functions can be run anywhere,
in any context, and have a good chance that they are going to behave
consistently. Just like in math, \(\text{cos}(\pi)\) is going to be
\(-1\) regardless of if you're calculating \(\text{cos}(\theta)\) in
an integral, an exponent, or any other context.
</p>

<p>
There are cases when this does not hold true for Lisp functions, like
when they rely on information read in from files, or in the state of
global variables, but, these functions are usually rare and
compartmentalized from the rest of an application.
</p>

<p>
This is great because it means that, if you're in a Lisp codebase, and
you find a function that looks useful, you can use it without much
worry. Just like in math, we can create more and more complex behavior
by <i>composing</i> Lisp functions. And importantly, like in math, we have
very few restrictions as to how we can compose them.

Lisp is highly expressive, functional, and also (generally)
interpreted. Let's take a moment and think about what each of these
qualities enables us to do when we're writing programs, and think
about how those properties then shape a Lisp based computing
environment.

Lisp's syntax is a simple data structure, a list, which allows us to
easily create parsers for custom syntax within Lisp itself. This
process, where a programming language extends itself, is called a
<i>macro</i>. An excellent use case for macros is in configuration files,
where we need a high level way of controlling a program. 
</p>

<p>
Emacs configuration files make heavy use of macros. Here's an example
from my Emacs configuration where I tell Emacs to use the <code>gruvbox-theme</code>
package, specifying what version of the <code>gruvbox</code> theme I want it to load
once it's finished parsing the package.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">(use-package gruvbox-theme
  :config
  (load-theme 'gruvbox-dark-hard))
</code></pre>

<p>
Notice that this doesn't make sense in terms of traditional function
syntax. <code>use-package</code> is a macro, and allows me to define the package
name as the first argument, along with a host of functions I want to
run when initializing the package (defined after the <code>:init</code> keyword,
not shown), and configuring the package (defined after the <code>:config</code>
keyword).
</p>

<p>
If you wanted a similar api in Python, you would have to manually
register a series of callbacks with whatever function is loading in
your package. This is why many Python projects will include a <code>json</code>
or <code>yaml</code> file to manage their configuration. In Lisp, we are able to
avoid separating configuration from code.
</p>

<p>
Scaled up to an entire computing environment, we are able to avoid a
good amount of complexity introduced by having to configure our
application across a variety of domain specific languages.
</p>

<p>
Macros are part of why Emacs is extremely <i>adaptable</i>, the language
can conform to the specific semantics we need to control our
computing.

<p>
Since Lisp is (mostly) functional, its much easier for us to reuse
existing code, and compose it into new systems.
</p>

<p>
This website is built from exploiting the functional nature of
Lisp. All of the content on this website is written in Emacs Org mode,
a package that provides an excellent interface for taking notes,
project management, interpreting code, and even creating spreadsheets.
Org mode ships with a suite of functions that let me take my <code>.org</code>
files and convert them into <code>html</code>. However, when I was first
experimenting with org's publishing capabilities, I found myself
wanting to change the aesthetics of the <code>html</code> it was producing.
</p>

<p>
I was able to achieve most of the aesthetic changes through custom
<code>css</code>, but some of the changes, related more to the structure of the
<code>html</code> it was producing, couldn't be fixed reasonably with stylesheets
or javascript.
</p>

<p>
Since (nearly) every function in the org mode package is a pure
function, I was able to take out a chunk the code that converted org
syntax to <code>html</code>, rewrite it, and hook it into the publishing pipeline
to achieve the custom behavior I wanted. Since the new function I
wrote abided by the same interface, and it worked perfectly with the
rest of the org package code!
</p>

<p>
Interfaces and pure functions make this experience possible. Doing the
same in an object-oriented codebase would be much harder.
</p>

<p>
Lisp's functional style also contributes to Emacs being
<i>self-documenting</i>, meaning that an Emacs user is always keypress away
from reading the documentation and implementation of any Elisp
function or macro in thier packages or configuration.
</p>

<p>
Since every Elisp function can have an associated docstring,
developers can document what their functions do as they are defining
them. And since many of these functions are <i>pure</i>, documentation can
stay self-contained to that function. They aren't tied to some
object's state, their behavior is entirely described by the operations 
performed using thier inputs.
</p>

<p>
When a new function is registered with Emacs, Emacs makes a record of
which file that function is located in, as well as its associated
docstring. This allows users to look up functions they come across by
placing their cursor over a function call and invoking the
<code>describe-function</code> method.

<h3 id="orgdf7061f">Iterative</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdf7061f">
<p>
Programs made using interpreted languages can be modified <i>while they
are running</i>. This is what allows web developers to modify websites
using javascript in browser extensions, what allows data scientists to
iterate on their machine learning models in Python without having to
restart, or recompile, their programs over and over again.
</p>

<p>
Interpreted languages excel at giving people high level control over
their computer, while also giving them room to experiment and
iterate. When developing software, the most critical component to
productivity is the tight feedback loop. No one can write complicated
code perfectly on their first try.
</p>

<p>
Interpreted languages allow developers to quickly build incremental
parts of their software, moving piece by piece once they're certain
that the foundation they just built is correct. People who work with
interpreted languages often work withing a <code>repl</code>, or a
Read-Eval-Print-Loop, where they type a command, and immediately
evaluate its result. Using the <code>repl</code> developers can write their
software line by line, testing each line, or handful of lines, as they
write them. This eliminates the need for a debugger that is often
needed when programming complex software in a compiled language.
</p>

<p>
In Emacs, Elisp being interpreted means that I can develop new
features for Emacs while it is running, within Emacs. Testing them
live within my editor, line by line. This makes Emacs incredibly
extendable, since you can build your plane as its flying. I'm not
aware of any other environments which do this better than Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Since Emacs is a tool for developers, its easy extendability allows
devs to quickly adapt their development environments to the type of
project that they're working on. If they're working on a web
application in one moment, and a graphical application in the next,
they can program Emacs to understand the context of the project that
they're in, and create custom keybindings for running compiliation
scripts, launching servers, opening windows on certain monitors,
whatever is suitable to achieve that tight feedback loop in the
codebase they're working on.
</p>

<p>
This is possible with the normal way that developers do their
computing, with some combination of an editor and a CLI. But that
approach cannot compete with the efficiency of your editor <i>being</i> a
CLI.

Highly productive computing environments put few conceptual
limitations on its users. These types of computing environments allow
users to exercise genuine creativity, and give them tools which they
can easily shape and modify. Emacs, and any future Lisp based
computing environments that come next, are uniquely advantaged in
providing this type of computing environment. When you're goal is to
operate your computer, you want something which easily molds to your
will, allows quick access to information, and allows you to create
tight feedback loops.
</p>

<p>
Emacs is not the final form of this, in practice it has many
issues. But I want to make the case for preserving and iterating on
the idea of Lisp based computing environments like Emacs. I want to
see the shell evolve into a more robust environment for running
interpreted languages, as opposed to the highly limiting experience it
is today.
</p>

<p>
Lisp and Emacs are well outside of the modern zeitgeist, and I hope
that changes. There's so much work that can be done to improve the
performance, and reliability, of Lisp. Adding more sophisticated type
systems, and improving Lisp compilers, are just the low hanging
fruit. And interpreted languages aren't going anywhere, even the most
hardcore C developers are often using Bash as their main interface for
their computing.
</p>

<p>
Lisp is simple, and magical, and powerful. And we haven't yet fully
exploited its potential. So I hope you take some time to ponder these
ideas that I've shared, and think about how we can build computing
environments that are productive, exciting, and creatively fulfilling.
