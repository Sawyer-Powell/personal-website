Genearative AI models, like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and others, are known to
have ingested copyrighted works into their training data. These models
provide facilities to generate new works that are sufficiently
different from those copyrighted works, to be recognized as the
official legal definition of a <i>derivative work</i>. Thinking about how
to regulate AI fairly, is difficult. AI models, on a surface level,
seem to be mimicking how human intelligence works. As people, we read,
watch, listen to copyrighted works, which inspires us to create new
art, movies, music, and literature. So, if we are to say that AI
models are violating copyright, how can we argue that the basic
process of our own creativity isn't?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6696554" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6696554">AI Eliminates the Moat of Copyright</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6696554">
<p>
The process is simple. Feed a large language model, like GPT-4o, all
the articles from the New York Times, and train it to produce articles
that match the NYT's style and tone. Everyday, pull the top articles from
the New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters, etc. and use another
large language model to pull out the key information from each of
these articles. Here's an example of what that key info could look
like coming out of an LLM (I generated the example with the Claude LLM
from Anthropic).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Article Title: "AI Revolution: How Artificial Intelligence is
Changing Workplaces in 2023"
</p>

<p>
Key Pieces of Information:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Introduction of AI Tools: Businesses are implementing AI to
improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.</li>
<li>Impact on Jobs: Certain jobs are becoming obsolete, while new
tech-driven roles are emerging.</li>
<li>Enhanced Decision-Making: AI algorithms help executives make
data-driven decisions with better accuracy.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then feed this information into the NYT article trained AI and ask it to
generate an article matching the New York Times tone and style.
</p>

<p>
In a few afternoons of work, it's possible, today, to generate an AI
news website, that covers the same events as the New York Times, in
the same tone, and style, without violating copyright. If a human did
the same thing, writing about current events reported by other sources
in their own words, its clear that this is not a violation of
copyright. However, it's critical to understand that AI is able to
extract the <i>value</i> of information at an <i>industrial scale</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf464895" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf464895">Copyright is About the <i>Value</i> of Information</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf464895">
<p>
The purpose of copyright, for all its strengths and weaknesses, is to
make markets of creative work possible. These markets are vital,
because without them, professional songwriters, journalists,
programmers, artists, etc. have few alternatives for income. Copyright
allows artists and companies to create novel pieces of work, on which
they can enforce an artificial scarcity, since copyright grants them
the sole rights of distribution. This artificial scarcity, coupled
with demand, creates a market for fundamentally non-scarce works, like
music, movies, code, and so on.
</p>

<p>
What are these people actually selling? They're selling information
which contains a certain amount of <i>value</i>, which makes that
information desirable for a customer. Before AI models, the only way
to duplicate that value, was to duplicate the information, to make a
copy of the work.
</p>

<p>
You can argue that a person could come along, listen to all the songs
from a musician, and create music that is highly inspired, but
sufficiently distinct, from the original musician. So, in this sense,
that person has extracted the value from that original musician's work,
and is reselling it for their own benefit. But, in the context of the
market for creative works, the fact that this can happen is a <i>very
good</i> thing. Here's why:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The musicians can create songs that are highly similar stylistically
to ther musicians, but if they create a song that is <i>sufficiently</i> the
same as another, they are in violation of copyright. I.e. singing a
song that has the same lyrics, melody, and chord progression, and
selling that without the original musician's consent.</li>
<li>Musicians creating similar music to each other is called a
<i>genre</i>. Musicians operating within a genre are encouraged, by the
design of copyright, to create distinct, compelling
works that diversify them from other musicians in that genre. The
best musicians advance their genre, making significant stylistic
contributions to the context in which they built their career.</li>
<li>Musicians operating within a genre have a bounded skillset, meaning
that the level of talent among these musicians is relatively
comparable. If there's a musician who dominates a genre, this is
always temporary, as a new musician, with new ideas, comes along
and steals the market.</li>
<li>This competitive landscape pushes professional musicians into
continually building a moat around the value of their art, to build
an edge, an identity. To do something distinct that is very hard for
another <i>person</i> to copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In order for copyright to do its job, it needs to be possible to have
a protected competitive landscape for creative work. AI is fully
capable of destroying this competitive landscape.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3a350ed" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3a350ed">Industrial Scale Value Extraction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3a350ed">
<p>
Key to the competitive market working is that it is <i>possible</i> for a
musician, artist, journalist, etc, to create work that is <i>hard</i> to
replicate. As we saw with the New York Times example, AI makes it
<i>easy</i> for any creative work to be replicated. Not only is it easy to
do, but it's easy to do at enormous scale. A skilled programmer can
write something which not only replicates the New York Times, but also
CNN, Fox News, Reuters, etc. in a week or less.
</p>

<p>
If people are unaware that those articles are generated by AI, they
will be receiving nearly the <i>same</i> amount of value they would get
from the original works. This is <i>catastrophic</i> for a productive and
healthy creative economy.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga40d5d3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga40d5d3">People Are Entitled to Their Work's <i>Value</i>, Not Just Its <i>Copies</i></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga40d5d3">
<p>
If a person produces a work, copyrights it, and that copyrighted work
is then used to train an AI, that person should be entitled to a share
of the value produced by the AI. A simple starting point is, if the AI
was trained on 100 megabytes of that person's copyrighted work, and
the AI was trained on 1000 megabytes of data in total, that person
should be entitled to 1/10th (divided by some number to account for the
value added by training the AI) of the revenue generated by the
AI. This, or the original author of the work agrees to some settlement
with the company for them to use their data.
</p>

<p>
To make this possible, if a company wants to sell an AI product, they
need to provide detailed documentation on what data they used to train
it. Just like if Coca-Cola wants to sell a drink, they must provide
nutrition facts.
</p>

<p>
If they then wants to use their AI model to create another AI model,
let's say using generated data. I.e. they train a model to produce
news articles, and train another model to mimic that news producing
AI. If that company chooses to sell that derivative AI, again they're
still obligated to report the source data that was used to train all
the AIs in their whole system, including the original news producing
AI. Most of the value of their models <i>comes from</i> that original
training data. That company should be forever obligated to compensate
the creators of that data, as long as their commercial products use
it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d77d4b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4d77d4b">A Better Data Economy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4d77d4b">
<p>
As we work on AI policy, we should be laser focused on creating a data
economy where creative people are both fairly compensated, while
allowing society to reap the enormous benefits of large AI systems. If
policies like the above get implemented, we can foresee the markets
for quality training data exploding. Since data trading is not just
being mediated by data brokers, and deals between large companies, but
between AI companies, and the artists and creative professionals
directly producing that work. The volume of trading would increase
<i>significantly</i>.
</p>

<p>
Independent creative professionals could end up making significant
passive income from large AI systems. Even if the data they provided
to OpenAI makes up one billionth of ChatGPTs training data, if OpenAI
is serving hundreds of millions of requests per second, their
compensation amount could add up quickly. We would also see the
emergence of large internet platforms for people to sell their
creative works as training data to AI companies.
</p>

<p>
If we don't implement modifications to copyright law, there will
likely be be huge negative economic, and social,
ramifications. However, if we modify the law smartly, we could see a
massive infusion of money into the hands of creative
workers. Importantly, when we think about AI policy, we need to think
about how to preserve the spirit, but not necessarily the details, of
copyright law. Focusing on the fundamental mechanism of copyright, how
creative workers protect the <i>value</i> of their work, and create
<i>scarcity</i>, is vital.
