Generative AI models, like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and others, are <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2024/04/nyt-v-openai-the-timess-about-face/">known</a> to
have incorporated copyrighted works into their training data. These
models provide facilities to generate completely new works that are
similar, but not the same, as those they were trained on. In some
cases models <i>cannot</i> produce output that exactly matches their
training data. Text, images, video, and audio that generative AI
models produce don't fit the official legal definition of a
<i>derivative work</i>, which would put them in violation of copyright.
</p>

<p>
Having your hard work used to train an AI, without your consent, and
without compensation, can feel like theft. In much the same way that
internet piracy feels like robbery. But, AI models give the appearance
of mimicking human intelligence. As people, we read, watch and listen
to copyrighted works. What we've consumed informs and teaches us how to
create new art, movies, music and literature. So, if we are to say
that AI models are violating copyright, or are breaking fair use, how
can we argue that the basic process of our own creativity isn't?
</p>

<h2 id="org479c6bb">AI Eliminates the Moat of Copyright</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org479c6bb">
<p>
Let's create a news website with articles entirely written by AI.
</p>

<p>
Feed a large language model (LLM), like GPT-4o, all the articles from
the New York Times. Fine tune this model to produce articles that
match the NYT's style and tone. Everyday, pull the top articles from
the New York Times. Use another large language model to pull out each
article's key pieces of information.
</p>

<p>
This produces a collection of articles alongside cliff notes on what
they cover. At this point we've preserved none of the original
content that was in those articles. Only the critical facts and
information.
</p>

<p>
Take these bullet points and feed them into our NYT AI and ask it to
generate full articles. This model will produce a series of well
written news articles, with relevant information, that provides a
simulated experience of reading an actual NYT article. This is a fully
fledged news site created without having to pay a single
journalist. Something we can easily build within few afternoons of
work, and a couple dozen dollars in API credits.
</p>

<p>
This feels unethical. But, if a human did the same thing, reading news
articles across the web, and writing their own articles based on that
reporting, its clear that this is not a violation of copyright. This
is a person producing a new work, not copying an existing one.
</p>

<p>
In both cases, writing a news article parroting information from
another source can devalue the work of the original
journalist. However, it's critical to understand that the AI is able
to extract the <i>value</i> of work done by New York Times journalists at an
<i>industrial scale</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org88bf2f5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org88bf2f5">The Value of Information</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org88bf2f5">
<p>
The purpose of copyright, for all its strengths and weaknesses, is to
make markets for non-scarce things possible. These markets are vital,
because without them, professional songwriters, journalists,
programmers, artists, etc. have few alternatives for income. Copyright
allows artists and companies to create novel pieces of work, on which
they can enforce an artificial scarcity. Copyright is similar to
patent law, where patent law creates a scarcity around who can
capitalize on ideas. Copyright grants its owner the sole rights of
distribution. Without copyright, music, ideas, code, could be copied
and replicated infinitely without consequence. This artificial
scarcity, coupled with demand, creates markets for things which are
fundamentally non-scarce.
</p>

<p>
What are these people actually selling? They're selling information
which contains a certain amount of <i>value</i>. This ineffable value is
what makes that information desirable for a customer. Before AI
models, the only way to duplicate that value, was to duplicate the
information, to make a copy of the work. Hence the strength and
motivation of copyright.
</p>

<p>
You can argue that a person could come along, listen to all the songs
from a musician, and create music that is highly inspired by them, but
distinct. It could be argued, that by learning to produce similar
music to that musician, they are stealing their ideas and devaluing
their work. But this is a <i>good</i> thing. In the context of the music
industry, this is competitive behavior.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Musicians can create songs that are highly similar stylistically
to other musicians, but if they create a song that is <i>sufficiently</i> the
same as another, they are in violation of copyright. I.e. singing a
song that has the same lyrics, melody, and chord progression, and
selling that without the original musician's consent.</li>
<li>Musicians creating similar music to each other is called a
<i>genre</i>. Musicians operating within a genre are encouraged, by the
design of copyright, to create distinct, compelling works that
diversify them from other musicians in that genre. The best
musicians push the boundaries of their genre. They make significant
stylistic contributions to their musical culture.</li>
<li>This competitive landscape pushes professional musicians to 
continually build a moat around the production of their art, to build
an edge, an identity. To do something distinct that is very hard for
another <i>person</i> to copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In order for copyright to do its job, it needs to be possible to have
a protected competitive landscape for creative work. If someone wants
to become a professional musician, or journalist, they need confidence
that they can build a sustainable career.
</p>

<h2 id="org2c2bfcf">Industrial Scale Value Extraction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c2bfcf">
<p>
Key to the competitive market working is that it is possible for a
musician, artist, journalist, etc, to create work that is <i>hard</i> to
replicate. As we saw with the New York Times example, AI makes it
<i>easy</i> for any creative work to be replicated. Not only is it easy to
do, but it's easy to do at enormous scale. A skilled programmer can
write something which not only replicates the New York Times, but also
CNN, Fox News, Reuters, etc. in a week or less. The same applies to
music using models like Suno.
</p>

<p>
If people are unaware that those articles are generated by AI, they
will be receiving a similar amount of value to what they would get
from the original works. Its not hard to see how this radically
changes the competitive landscape for journalism.
</p>

<p>
We need new market mechanisms and regulations to preserve creative
markets.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge9fee57" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge9fee57">People Are Entitled to Their Work's <i>Value</i>, Not Just Its <i>Copies</i></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9fee57">
<p>
If a person produces a work, copyrights it, and that copyrighted work
is then used to train an AI, that person should be entitled to a share
of the value produced by the AI. A simple starting point is, if the AI
was trained on 100 megabytes of that person's copyrighted work, and
the AI was trained on 1000 megabytes of data in total, that person
should be entitled to 1/10th (divided by some number to account for the
value added by training the AI) of the revenue generated by the
AI. This, or the original author of the work agrees to some settlement
with the company for them to use their data.
</p>

<p>
To make this possible, if a company wants to sell an AI product, they
need to provide detailed documentation on what data they used to train
it.
</p>

<p>
If they then want to use their AI model to create another AI model,
using generated data. I.e. they train a model to produce news
articles, and train another model to mimic that news producing AI. If
they chooose to sell that derivative AI, they're still obligated to
report the source data that was used to train all the AIs in their
whole system. Most of the value of their models <i>comes from</i> that
original training data. That company should be forever obligated to
compensate the creators of that data, as long as their commercial
products use it.
</p>

<p>
This is not a simple task, but not an impossible one. To achieve this
kind of a paper trail we would likely need open internet platforms for
people to buy and sell training data. Alongside government
intervention to ensure that companies selling AI products are
compensating those who created the data. We also need stricter laws to
put ownership of data back in the hands of those who create it. Non
copyrighted data, like social media posts, emails, text messages, are
fair game for tech companies to train AI models.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1f6088c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1f6088c">A Better Data Economy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1f6088c">
<p>
As we work on AI policy, we should be laser focused on creating a data
economy where creative work is fairly compensated, while still
allowing society to reap the enormous benefits of large AI
systems. Designing regulations are hard because you want to preserve
competitive behavior, while mitigating the consequences of open
competition. Deferring large sums of money to the people who created
the training data reduces incentives to create large new AI
models. While keeping the status quo allows AI companies to consume
entire sectors of the economy, concentrating money and power. Much of
the investment in AI right now is <i>predicated</i> on the fact that this
concentration is possible.
</p>

<p>
Independent creative professionals could potentially make significant
passive income from large AI systems. Even if the data they provided
to OpenAI makes up one one-billionth of ChatGPTs training data, if
OpenAI is serving millions of requests per second, their compensation
amount could add up quickly.
</p>

<p>
If we don't implement modifications to copyright law, there will
likely be be huge negative economic, and social,
ramifications. However, if we modify the law smartly, we could see a
massive infusion of money into the hands of creative
workers. Importantly, when we think about AI policy, we need to think
about how to preserve the spirit, but not necessarily the details, of
copyright law. Focusing on the fundamental mechanism of copyright, how
creative workers protect the <i>value</i> and ownership of their work is
vital.
