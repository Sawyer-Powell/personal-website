Capitalism is all about capital, it's about what society lets you do
when you <i>own</i> things. When you own very big things, like a factory,
or a mine, or a lot of farmland, a capitalist society allows you to
hire people to plow your fields, to dig your mine, and to work your
machines. You hire people to <i>exploit</i> your capital. The people
working in your factory agree to work for some wage, and you sell what
they produce for a profit. The money you make selling what the workers
produce must be greater than the money you pay them in order to turn
that profit. Even though you didn't actually make the product, your
contract with the worker allows you to capture the value created by
their work. To me, there are three things that define a capitalist
society, you can own capital, you can hire people to use that capital,
and you are entitled to everything produced using that capital.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5a2483a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5a2483a">The Fundamental Power Structure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a2483a">
<p>
In a capitalist society, you have owners, and you have employees. Now,
imagine a village inhabited by a wealthy family who owns a large
farm. They hire people in the community to work on their farm for a
wage. They are the largest farm in the region, and let's say they are
also the most efficient. This means that they are making the biggest
profit, and their wealth growth is outpacing the surrounding
farms. They have some competitors, but they're already ahead and want
the best talent, so they pay their workers slightly above what their
competitors offer. Eventually, the family decides to reinvest their
farm's profit by buying up smaller farms.
</p>

<p>
From the perspective of the worker, their options over employers
quickly dwindle. Acting in their best interests, the family will
decide to slowly lower the wages of the workers until they notice
workers leaving for other villages. The family is operating a monopoly
on agriculture in the village. This monopoly drives down wages over
time, while the economic output (amount of food grown and exported)
might have simultaneously increased.
</p>

<p>
The family who owns the farm also own all the food grown on that
farm. This fact of ownership is reinforced by the government through
the hiring contracts with the workers, and with the family's property
rights over the farm. Who owns the farm is what fundamentally defines
the power imbalance between the family and the farm workers. The
better the farm does, the better the family does. Critically, the
performance of the farm doesn't necessarily have any relationship on
the economic wellbeing of the workers.
</p>

<p>
As the farm grows larger and more efficient, these gains get
concentrated into proportionally fewer hands. As the family becomes
richer, and gains more control over farmland, they gain more control
over the local food economy. This means they can decide what crops are
available to people, who is allowed to buy the crops they produce,
etc. They translate their economic power into something that is almost
indistinguishable from political power. This political power, created
through their domination of the market, gives them more levers to
increase the scale of their business. Which propels more growth, and
definitionally more inequality.
</p>

<p>
Capitalism, defined by right to own, right to hire, and right to
capture, has the fundamental property of inequality baked in. And by
its structure, economic growth will translate into increased
inequality, holding all else equal. Notice that the fundamental
property of capitalism is not a market, its an ownership structure
which prioritizes concentrating wealth into the hands of those who
already have it. The market just exists as something that can be
harnessed in service of the power structure.
</p>

<h2 id="orgd3b44d9">Markets aren't a problem, but they aren't a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd3b44d9">
<p>
All capitalist economies have monopolies and oligopolies. Most sectors
in capitalist economies are dominated by a handful of companies. Some
companies dominate across multiple sectors. Which companies dominate
each sector changes over time, new competitors arise, and innovation
disrupts existing leaders. But the basic fact remains that most
econommic sectors remain relatively concentrated. This naturally
implies economic inequality given a capitalist ownership
structure. Few companies means a handful of wealthy owners, and
reduced wage competition.
</p>

<p>
Even as companies compete, and the overall economy grows,
concentration does not tend to shrink. In some cases, technological
advancement increases market concentration, since a single highly
innovative company can quickly dominate an entire sector. Markets can
never solve this inequality because markets didn't cause this
inequality, the ownership structure is solely responsible.
</p>

<h2 id="orgdba601a">Solving the problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdba601a">
<p>
The fundamental issue with capitalism is that it freely permits
unchecked concentration of wealth and power within private
entities. Those who are wealthy are legally entitled to leverage the
economy to increase their wealth. This creates an economic system
which is fundamentally powered by inequality. At its core capitalism
is an ownership model.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, exactly what ownership model should be adopted to
replace capitalism is an extremely challenging question. Systems which
distribute power are always more complicated than those which
concentrate it. There are many successful models out there for how
collective ownership can work, coops are one example. Permitting a
capitalist ownership model for small companies but then requiring them
transition to sharing equity amongst employees once they reach a
certain size is another option. To me, a post-capitalist society is
one which actively works to design policy and laws to deter power from
concentrating, while carefully designing incentives around which the
economy can organize.
</p>

<p>
Post-capitalist societies are those which could leverage markets <i>more
effectively</i> than capitalist ones. Large megacorps become slow and
inefficient as they scale in size, making them unable to handle
disruptive competitors. Large corporations, which must enforce a
hierarchical management structure to preserve ownership, are not too
dissimilar from communist central planners. Large companies often
become overwhelemed with bureaucracy as they scale. Collective
ownership models are unburdened with inefficient hierarchies. They can
organize into hierarchies when needed, and can distribute themselves
horizontally to attack problems in parallel as necessary. Organizing
collectives is hard, but companies which organize horizontally have
the capacity to be vastly more efficient than those which cling to
hierarchies and ownership. Valve software is an interesting case study
for some of these principles. The economic growth of democratic
societies versus monarchical socieities is another interesting case
study.
</p>

<p>
Post capitalist socities still have competition, they still have
companies.  People are still greedy and want to get rich. Companies
still work to maximize their profits. But, when they succeed and get
rich, those who helped build the company own what they built. There
will still be economic inequality, but this inequality is not going to
span orders of magnitude.
</p>

<p>
Dreaming past capitalism means dreaming past how we understand
ownership. It means abandoning the notion that wealth entitles us to
use the labor of others to enrich ourselves. Much like democracy was
developed to end the tyranny of kings, collective ownership must be
developed to end the concentration of economic power. Restructuring
how ownership works is not easy, democracy wasn't easy either. The
simplicity of a monarchy is much easier to reason about than the
immense complexity of a modern democracy. But, few people would ever
consider going back.
