Deep Learning is a complex topic, one that has always interested me,
but one that I've struggled to get a foothold in learning. I've been
fortunate to have discovered the learning material provided by
<a href="https://fast.ai">fast.ai</a>, a nonprofit research group dedicated to making AI more
accessible.  Led by the inspiring <a href="https://jeremy.fast.ai/">Jeremy Howard</a>, he and his team have
provided masterful education material on a swath of AI topics. Their
teaching methodology is simple, direct, and laser focused on
empowering you to solve real problems. Best of all, it's totally free.

On a recent flight from San Francisco to visit family in Indianapolis,
I got through the first 100 or so pages of this book. It's been a long
time that any book has kept my attention like this has. I hope to
summarize some of the things that I've learned in the book so far, as
well as provide some code examples of some of the initial models I
have trained.

<h3 id="org0928bce">What is Deep Learning?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0928bce">
<p>
Deep learning is a collection of techniques for internalizing
relationships.  The relationships that deep learning is typically used
to understand are complex and difficult to articulate.  Tesla might
use deep learning to understand the relationship between the body
language of a person crossing the street, and their expected position
on the street after a given period of time. Once this relationship is
understood, Tesla could use it to help their self-driving vehicles
better avoid collisions with jaywalkers. Much like how our intuitive
understanding of the relationship between the movement and position of
objects helps us to do activities like juggling and baseball.
</p>

<p>
Understanding relationships helps us to make predictions, it also
helps us to classify things. When I look out at the world, I'm able to
break down what I see into various different <i>things</i>. That's an
apple, that's my laptop, that's a blanket. How am I able to do this?
My brain is able to understand the relationship between patterns of
light and a huge dictionary of objects and things. This relationship
can be understood almost like a mathematical function, which takes
light as input and produces a name as output.
</p>

<p>
If I want to do the same thing with my phone's camera, like what
<a href="https://lens.google/">Google Lens</a> does, I'll need to somehow teach my phone the relationship
between patterns of pixels in its images and a huge dictionary of
objects and things.  Getting those relationships is effectively
intractable through traditional algorithms (imagine trying to write a
program that could identify a corgi in an image, knowing that, at the
pixel level, different corgi images would be <i>completely</i>
different). Deep learning provides state of the art techniques for
internalizing relationships, like that between an image and a
label. One such deep learning technique, or more precisely
<i>architecture</i>, is the Convolutional Neural Network (or CNN for
short). CNNs were originally designed to help us model relationships
where images are the input. This leads to products like Google Lens
where it seems the program, almost magically, <i>knows</i> what it is
looking at.
</p>

<p>
Deep learning models are computer programs, and like any computer
program they take data as input and produce data as output. All deep
learning programs start as an implementation of a certain
architecture, like the CNN, which defines a blueprint for their
structure. Much like a fisherman would design their net in such a way
to pick up only the fish they wanted from the sea, a deep learning
program's architecture is specifically designed to capture only the
type of relationships the data scientist is interested in.
</p>

<p>
Once the architecture is configured, data is fed into the program,
which the program uses to produce an output. The output of the program
is measured against some criteria, allowing us to adjust the internals
of the program to (hopefully) produce an output closer to what we
expect. We keep feeding inputs into the program, measuring its
outputs, and tweaking its internals until we are satisfied with its
behavior. This feedback loop is not a manual process, but is managed
by a host of clever machine learning algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Once a deep learning program is behaving how we like it, we can say
our program implements a deep learning <i>model</i>. We have <i>modeled</i> the
relationship that we were interested in. These <i>models</i> can usually be
exported from the program into a file and shared. Websites like
<a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> allow netizens to share and develop such models with each
other.

<p>
Deep learning architectures allow us to internalize relationships in
data. Deep learning programs allow us to generate and make use of deep
learning <i>models</i>, which encode these relationships. The
<i>Convolutional Neural Network</i> (CNN) is a type of deep learning
architecture which allows us to capture relationships involving
images, specifically where the image needs to be the input in a deep
learning program.

<div id="outline-container-org4a8cef8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4a8cef8">Getting the data</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4a8cef8">
<pre><code class="language-python">from fastai.vision.all import * path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'
</code></pre>

<p>
This imports all the functions from the fast.ai vision library and
downloads all the images from the Oxford IIIT Pet dataset from the
fast.ai datasets collection.  <code>untar_data</code> downloads and extracts all
the images from the provided URL into a directory on your computer (it
was <code>/root/.fastai/data</code> on my colab container).
</p>

<p>
The <code>untar_data</code> function returns a python <code>Path</code> object, which
enables the nifty <code>/'images'</code> syntax.
</p>

<p>
In the downloaded dataset, in the <code>images</code> folder, is a list of over
7,000 images of dogs and cats.  Each image is labeled with the breed
of the animal, alongside a number.  E.g. <code>shih-tzu-12.jpg</code> indicates
that this image is the 12th Shih-Tzu that's appeared in the dataset.
By convention, the dataset capitalizes the first letter of the file if
it contains a cat, and doesn't if it contains a dog.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge512825" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge512825">Preparing the Data</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge512825">
<pre><code class="language-python">dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(
    path, get_image_files(path),
    lambda x: x[0].isupper(), valid_pct=0.2,
    seed=42, item_tfms=Resize(224))
</code></pre>

<p>
Next, we need to prepare our data for being fed into a deep learning
program. To do this, fast.ai provides a whole host of wrappers around
the <code>DataLoader</code> object provided by PyTorch.  fast.ai's <code>DataLoader</code>
objects offer convenient ways of quickly formatting and preprocessing
our training data. In the code above, we pass in the path of where to
save an export of our model (in our case we just choose the same
folder as our dataset, it's arbitrary), next we pass in a list of
image file paths, as a shorthand we use fast.ai's <code>get_image_files</code>
function to retrieve all the image files in our <code>path</code> variable. Next,
we define our labelling function, which in our case should be a
function that returns <code>true</code> if the image is of a cat and <code>false</code> if
it's a dog. Remember, we can distinguish between the two based on
whether the first letter of the filename is capitalized.
</p>

<p>
<code>valid_pct</code> defines how much of our training set should be set aside
for use as a validation set. We set aside a portion of our data for
validating our model against. If we trained on all the data, the model
might simply memorize the relationships between the inputs and
outputs. This is called <i>overfitting</i> and is a major concern in deep
learning, as well as many other fields in machine learning. So, we set
aside a <i>validation</i> set that we only use to validate how well our
model is performing. In the above, we ask fast.ai to set aside 20% of
our training data.
</p>

<p>
Since deep learning employs the use of random numbers we set <code>seed</code> to
be an arbitrary number, this way we can get reproducible results on
repeated training attempts. This makes it easier for us to qualify
performance improvements we're making to our models.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we define an item transform. Item transforms are functions
that are applied to all of items (in our case, files) in our
dataset. We set our images to be resized to 224px squares, that are
maximized either in height or in width. 224px is a historical
standard, anything can be used here. It's important though that they
are all the same size, with larger sizes creating a tradeoff in
increased model performance vs increased training time. This has to do
with how the model ingests the data and learns (partially since deep
learning models accept a fixed amount of input parameters).
</p>

<p>
<i>Full function signature for reference</i>
</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(path:str|Path, fnames:list, label_func:callable, valid_pct=0.2, seed=None, item_tfms=None, batch_tfms=None, img_cls=, bs:int=64, val_bs:int=None, shuffle:bool=True, device=None)
</code></pre>

<div id="outline-container-org1af4829" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1af4829">Learning from the Data</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1af4829">
<pre><code class="language-python">learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)
</code></pre>

<p>
We then create a <code>cnn_learner</code>, which creates an object that we can
use to train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). CNN, as mentioned
before, are widely used for classifying the contents of images. We
pass in our <code>DataLoader</code>, and the specific architecture/type of CNN
that we want to train (<code>resnet34</code> in our case, which corresponds to
the resnet architecture at 34 layers). We also specify that we want to
display the <code>error_rate</code> in the console at the end of every <i>epoch</i>,
meaning at the end of each full pass through our dataset.
</p>

<p>
One thing that isn't shown here is the fact that the <code>cnn_learner</code>
function will, by default, initially download a pre-existing model
when it initializes the CNN. After the model is downloaded,
<code>cnn_leaner</code> will chop off the last layer (which are used for
generating the model output), and replace it with a last layer suited
to the format of the data specified in the <code>DataLoader</code>, with random
initial configuration. This allows us to create a super powerful model
much more cheaply than if we started from scratch, and with a <i>lot</i>
less data. We can take advantage of the work already done by
pre-existing models, since a general model trained for recognition on
millions of images will have transferable skills in detecting cats
and dogs in the dataset we're interested in.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">learn.fine_tune(1)
</code></pre>

<p>
Finally, we train our model. Here we use the method <code>fine_tune</code> with a
a parameter of <code>1</code>, which means 1 <i>epoch</i>, specifying that training
should only consist of one full pass through the data. More epochs can be
used at the expense of longer training times, good to start at a low
number generally, more epochs can always be run later.
</p>

<p>
Since we are using a pre-existing dataset we use the <code>fine_tune</code> function
to train our data. Fine tuning is different than training from scratch, and
there are some tricks baked into the <code>fine_tune</code> function that are designed
to preserve the capabilities of the base model. One such trick is prioritizing
updating later <i>layers</i> of the model rather than earlier ones, since early
layers usually contain many of the fundamental features that describe the
domain we're interested in, something we want the base model to provide us.
</p>

<p>
Training on my free tier Google Colab workspace took around 2 minutes.

<pre><code class="language-python">img = PILImage.create("path-to-image")

<p>
<code>PILImage</code> is a general class in the fast.ai library for handling images.
Here we point it to the file path of the image we're interested in classifying
and pass it into <code>learn.predict()</code>. This uses the model we trained above to
to judge whether the image contains a cat or a dog. Note that when the model
is trained, using it to predict things is much quicker than training it. This
is generally true.

<p>
To learn some more about how to find my own data and prepare it, I decided
to train a model using the same technique as was done for cats and dogs, but
for differentiating humans. I picked out 4 of some of my favorite musicians,
and the results were very interesting.
