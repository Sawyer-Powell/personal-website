* INTRO

:END:

I was born into a small town in Indiana in the year 2000. For the first 8
years of my life I was homeschooled so I could travel all over the world with
my parents. Eventually, my parents  decided that my sister and I needed more structured
learning, so in fourth grade, they enrolled us in the International School of Indiana.
There I developed my love of math, computing, and physics. After high school,
I enrolled in the Purdue University Honors Engineering program with ambitions
of becoming an aerospace engineer. I struggled to find meaning and clarity in
my studies throughout the first few years, switching majors a few times until
I landed on Economics, graduating with honors, a B.S. in Economics and a minor
in mathematics. The passion I developed in high school for computing returned
to me towards the end of college, and I picked up a job with [[https://counterpart.biz][Counterpart]] upon
graduating as a manager-developer hybrid. I live with my beautiful fiancee in
the San Francisco Bay Area.

* Interests

Alongside computing, there are many other subjects that spark my interest.

** Buddhism

I find Buddhist philosophy incredibly profound. Throughout college I struggled with
depression. One day, while scrolling YouTube, I came across a guided mediation by the
late zen master [[https://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh][Thich Nhat Hanh]]. It was only about 20 minutes, but sitting in that silence,
being with reality, had a deep effect on me. Walking to a club meeting after that session
was transformative, I felt with connected with the wind against my skin, the play of colors
on the sidewalk, the moisture of my mouth. I saw something beyond the pen in my mind that
I'd been running circles in.

If you're new to Buddhist philosophy, it studies how humans can transform their suffering
through a process of deeply connecting with reality. It was started by an ancient Indian prince,
Siddhartha Gautama, who, according to legend, renounced his royalty to learn how to achieve 
freedom from unhappiness. He sought out forest-dwelling spiritual teachers, quickly outgrowing 
them, eventually setting off on his own. On a fateful night, sitting in meditation, he solved
the riddle, setting off a groundbreaking paradigm shift in his mind. For the rest of his life
he wandered India, forming a large egalitarian community of monks and nuns, dedicating himself
towards helping all living beings overcome their stress, anxiety, and suffering.

Throughout the year I go to week long meditation retreats at [[https://uszen.org][Amatavihara]] with my fiancee,
a meditation center in Boyds, Maryland.

** Music

Towards the end of high school I started writing songs on my guitar, getting into piano as well
in college. There is something deeply spiritual in music that is hard to articulate. I love music
where you can feel the soul of the artist, where it's clear they have a deep connection to the
art they are making. Music like this lifts my heart, reconnects me with the profundity of the life
that I'm living.

*** Some of my favorite songs

** Computing
*** Distributed systems
