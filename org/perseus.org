The Perseus Cluster Project has the goal of allowing anyone and everyone to easily, and quickly, set up a home cloud
computing cluster. Old computers aren't slow, they lack good software. PCP hopes to unlock the power in our old technology,
allowing hackers, tinkerers, and those interested in distributed computing to easily explore the field with their old laptops
and desktops. PCP is designed to be fully transparent, modifiable and extensible, embodying a software philosophy
pioneered by the Emacs editor. I work on this project in my free time after work, you can find my notes and (more structured)
blog posts on this page.
